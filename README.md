## Hi, I’m Anna Pugachova 👋

I’m a software developer focused on building clean, reliable, and user-friendly web and mobile applications. My strength is in front-end development with a solid foundation in UI/UX, accessibility, and real-world production systems.

I currently work as a **Front End Developer / Designer**, building customer-facing features using ASP.NET, C#, JavaScript, SQL, and modern front-end practices. I also have hands-on experience developing **mobile applications** with Flutter and Android.

Alongside my core work, I’m exploring **AI-powered features** and integrations, focusing on practical use cases that enhance user experience rather than experimental hype.

## What I do
- Build and maintain production web applications
- Develop front-end features with JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and ASP.NET
- Create mobile applications using Flutter and Android
- Work with SQL-backed data, APIs, and dynamic UI components
- Apply UI/UX, mobile-first, and ADA accessibility standards
- Collaborate in Agile/Scrum teams using Git
